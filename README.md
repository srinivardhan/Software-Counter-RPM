This is a simple work to measure the RPM of the wheel using a simple software counter and IR Sensor 

There are certain initializing done.
The 'd' is the distance from the centre to the point where the IR sensor is placed horizontally to the surface of wheel
The 'n' is the number of spikes in the wheel.

The IR output is ZERO( == 0) when the IR is blocked.
